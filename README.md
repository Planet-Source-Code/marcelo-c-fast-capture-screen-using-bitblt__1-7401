## FAST Capture Screen, Using BitBlt\.


</div>

### Description

Captures Screen as fast as it is possible, I myself have used that old method of sending a PrntScreen Key deal, but this is HOT, it just uses Bitblt... Might come in handy for that guy who is making BOS or whatever its called. Capturing the screen though any other method is only doomed to be slower :)
